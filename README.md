# Utility scripts and some notes

## js-lint-git

Run eslint on your git files. Interface is similar to git diff. Will run only on js files.

```bash
$ js-lint-git --cached
$ # ...
$ js-lint-git HEAD^^
```

## run-in-new-tab

Run your command in new tab for your chosen terminal (set `TERMINAL=myawesometerminal` inside script)

Requires **xdotool** to be installed and visible in $PATH
